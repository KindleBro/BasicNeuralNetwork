# Basic Neural Network
A class based Python neural network using numpy.

## Current features:

 * Dynamic input & output features.
 * Per layer activation functions.
 * New: Adaptive learning rate.
    * Will be updated with better halt detection.
 * New: Batching.
    * The ability to batch is now supported, however it current bugs and will skip the final batch of each epoch. On my todo list to fix.
